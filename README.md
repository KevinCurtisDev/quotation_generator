# Quotation Generator
This is the 5th project in the openclassrooms Front end developer bachelor diploma. The project brief is as follows:

Try the app live here: [Quotation generator](https://the-masta-blasta.github.io/quotation_generator/)

* The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

* Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

* The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

* Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

* Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

* Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program

## UX
I made use of a simple design, with all the features of the random quote generator displayed in a simple form. 

### User stories: 
I want to... 
* ..get a random quote. 
* ..get a few random quotes.
* ..get a life qoute.
* ..get a non specific quote.
* ..quit the quote generator.


## Features
The above user stories were achieved by implementing a form that included radio buttons -allowing the user to choose between life quotes or miscelaneous quotes. There is also an input field allowing the user to choose up to five quotes. The user can click the "generate quote(S)" button or, if they want to quit, the quit button.


## Technologies used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Testing
Manual testing was carried out, using live server in Visual Studio, applying the listed user stories above. 

## Deployment
The app was deployed on github pages and can be viewed at the following link: [Quotation Generator](https://the-masta-blasta.github.io/quotation_generator/)

## Further enhancements
I would like to connect the quote generator engine to a quotation API endpoint in order to expand the number of possible quotes generated. I would also like to add a few more categories to choose from.
